  // we can do a soft redirect based on a cookie, OR we'll let the client handle it if the middleware
  // approach is too complex for standard firebase without setting custom cookies.

  // Actually, the prompt states: "Create middleware.ts at root to protect /dashboard and /publish routes.
  // If not authenticated, redirect to /?login=required."

  // Since we use Firebase client auth, the auth token isn't automatically in cookies.
  // We'll write a simple middleware that redirects to /?login=required if there's no custom 'auth' cookie.
  // To make it fully work according to prompt, we should just assume the cookie `isLogged=true` is set on login.
  // Wait, I will just let the client side `useAuth` handle the actual redirection and use middleware to 
  // check a generic cookie. BUT, I didn't set a cookie in AuthContext.

  // To strictly follow the prompt, I will implement it.
  // And I'll update AuthContext to set/remove 'auth-session' cookie.
